## Global Biodiversity finance flows and the nexus

Part of work for Chapter 6 of the IPBES Nexus Assessment

Author: Andrea Pacheco

#### Description:
This repository contains:
- data gathered from academic and grey literature sources on the volumes of (private, public, and other) financial flows to global biodiversity and the extent to which these flows may relate to other nexus elements (food, water, health, and climate)
- scripts for analyzing, plotting, and generally visualizing these financial flows:
  * BD_fin: plots treemaps of nature-positive, nature-negative, and mixed flows
  * finFlow_Sankey: plots Sankey network diagram(s) of the volumes of financing that are estimated to be flowing into NbS (and how these connect to nexus elements) - based on UNEP's 2023 report State of Finance for Nature
