Please note with regard to the Sankey plot (BDFin_positiveFlows_simplified4SPM):

As I previously explained to Yuka Estrada:

I have to share/save the Sankey diagram as an .html file because the code that I use for making it is meant to make it interactive, so one can toggle the flows for their values (click here for an example: https://pacheco-andrea.github.io/finFlows_nexus/outputs/BDFin_positiveFlows.html) The .html format also means that you can click and drag each of the "nodes" to follow whatever order you prefer. For instance, I like putting the "undisclosed/unclear" category last. 
As suggested by the Data TSU as well - the simplest way of converting this .html to a .png is a simple screenshot (as I've currently done and attached). I've just tried several other methods of conversion directly in R, but they all lead to simply capturing a screenshot. 
(By the way, all the code and data used to produce these figures is found here: https://github.com/pacheco-andrea/finFlows_nexus). 

Please also note, that as suggested in the chapter comments by Pam and Paula, the static version of this figure (i.e., not the interactive one), should probably have the numbers labelled on top of the flows (for instance, the top "ribbon" should say $76 billion (flowing from Domestic budgets to biodiversity)) - as seen when toggling the .html file.
